# Anagram (CSharp) Test Program
Author: Anthony S. West, 2022/08/01 (for C#)

Compares two strings to see if they are an anagram.

Example, run from console:
```
Anagram.exe testStr testStr2
```

Assumptions: While the program shouldn't crash for invalid inputs, it is expected that the two strings are alpha chars only. Non alpha chars are ignored, meaning "test one" and "testeno" will test true as an anagram.
